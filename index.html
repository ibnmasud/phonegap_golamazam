                    	<p>Interview of Professor Ghulam Azam on Bangla Language Movement Conducted by Dhaka Digest, January 1979 <br>
						[As we of Dhaka Digest visited him for the interview it was evident that he is a regular reader of our magazine, he talked to us with much interest and sincerity despite having a very busy schedule and workload. 
						We hope this interview will provide much valuable information for writing a comprehensive history of the Language Movement in future.] <br><br>
						<h2>The Interview:</h2>
							Question: When do you think was the beginning of the Language Movement? Were you involved with it from the very beginning? <br>
							Prof Ghulam Azam (GA): Tamuddun Majlis initiated this campaign. But I do not remember the exact time period. As far as I remember,
							I got involved in March 1948 just before the visit of Quaid-e-Azam [Muhammad Ali Jinnah].<br><br>
							Q: who were the main initiators of this campaign?<br>
							GA: Tamuddun Majlis, which was established and led by the DU youth leader Prof Abul Quasem, was the main initiator of this language campaign.
							The demand for establishing Bangla as a state language turned into a public movement just before the visit of Quaid-e-Azam [Jinnah].
							The movement became slightly diminished after the signing of a treaty between the government and the ‘Movement for State Language’ committee, and also due to the effect of the Jinnah’s influential personality. However, although it did not become a full mass movement by that time, the campaign was becoming stronger by day.
							It became a strong student movement after the speech of Prime Minister Nazimuddin at a Paltan rally in 1952 [rejecting the demand], and turned into a mass public movement after the firing on the student rally [on 21 February 1952].<br><br>
							Q: When did you enroll at Dhaka University? When did you get elected as the GS of DUCSU? What was the condition of student union activities at that time?<br>
							GA: I enrolled at DU right after passing my I.A. exams in 1944. I passed B.A. in 1946 and when I was a M.A. student I was elected as the GS of the Fazlul Haque Muslim Hall for the 1946-47 session. Then I was elected as the GS of the central students union DUCSU for the 1947-48 session.<br>
							DU was a residential/boarding university from the beginning. Every hall had so much extra-academic activities that the role of the central students union was very limited. There were two Muslim halls and two Hindu halls. All of them had so many literary programs, drama/theatre, sports and religious activities to keep the students very busy and active.<br>
							As a result of the Pakistan Independence Movement, the students were divided into Muslim and Hindu halls, so the central university union was non-functional for few years. It became active again in 1946 and I was elected as its GS the next year. The student union did not have any political activities; those were limited within the halls.<br><br>
							Q: What was the reaction from the ordinary students towards the Language Movement at the beginning?<br>
							GA: Ordinary students were not very aware about this movement/campaign before the visit of Quid-e-Azam [Jinnah]. It first attracted their attention during the campaign of 11th March [related to Jinnah’s visit]. There was no sign of opposition to this demand from the students. Either they supported it or they kept silent. Mass reaction started in 1952.<br><br>
							Q: Were you involved with the Tamuddun Majlis?<br>
							GA: I was not directly involved with it during my student life. When I was a lecturer at Rangpur College, I was arrested for being involved with the Language Movement in 1952. After being released, I was invited by brother Sulaiman and joined the Majlis. I was the chief of the Majlis in Rangpur until April 1955. I used to attend their meetings and camps during that period. <br><br>
							Q: When and how did you first participate directly in the Language Movement?<br>
							GA: I got involved directly with the Language Movement in March 1948. I remember that on 11th March 1948, a group of us students went to campaign/picket at T&T office. 10 or 12 of us were arrested from that spot. We were taken to the Tejgaon police station. We were kept in a room that has a leaky roof made of tin. When the rain started we all got wet. I remember that the residents of neighboring homes brought snacks/dry foods to us. We spent whole day eating those dry foods. We were released in the evening.<br><br>
							Q: Please shed some lights about the negative reaction that you received during the initial period of the Language Movement. You must have some knowledge about a particular incident that took place in Old Dhaka?<br>
							GA: Other people already have said enough about this. Since the period of the Pakistan [Independence] Movement, as Siddique Bazar, Bongshal and Chak Bazar were Muslim dominated areas, we had to visit those areas for support for any campaigns. One day I took a student rally to Chak Bazar. I was shouting slogans for the Language Movement from a chunga [tin-mike]. As we passed the jail gate, our jailed colleagues from inside the jail also joined us with slogans. We heard their slogans as far as the end of Chak Bazar. <br>
							When I started my speech near Chak Bazar Masjid, a mixed group of pro-government thugs and those opposing the Language Movement attacked us. They snatched the mike from me and started hitting me with it on my head and body. We tried to explain to them and calmed them down. Those who behaved with us like this on that day on the question of our Language Movement, some of them are still alive. I met many of them a lot of times in my later life. <br>
							I made speeches from the tin-mike [chunga] at many other places. I gave slogans like ‘Bangla – Urdu are two brothers, We want Bangla with Urdu’. The aborigines of Dhaka used to speak a colloquial Urdu, so we never got any support from them for Bangla. However, not everyone attacked Bangla supporters. In the pockets of old Dhaka where Mawlana Deen Muhammad, Mawlana Jafar Ahmad Usmani and Mawlana Shamsul Haq Faridpuri had a lot of influence, people were inclined more towards Urdu. <br>
							Many people were suspicious about the Language Movement as there was propaganda that it was a Hindu movement instigated by India. I must admit that, not everyone got involved with this movement with the same [sincere] intention.<br>
							I remember another incident. I had some contact with Saiyed Ali Ahsan [a renowned writer and intellectual] as a member of the East Pakistan Literary Union. I had an argument with him regarding the state language. He was opposed to the Language Movement. There were many people like this. This proves that many intellectuals and civil society members were not supportive of the Language Movement at that time.<br><br>
							Q: What was the logic in support of the Language Movement? Please shed some light on the situation at that time.<br>
							GA: The majority population of [combined] Pakistan was Bangla speaking people. So it was a logical demand that Bangla should be one of the state and official languages of Pakistan. <br>
							Many of the Bangla speaking people did not know that Urdu is not the mother-tongue language of most West Pakistanis. For this reason, when Quaide Azam Jinnah declared that ‘Urdu will be the only state language of Pakistan’, most Bengalis considered that to be an enforcement of language by the West Pakistanis upon the East Pakistanis. As non-Bengali Pakistanis in Bangladesh spoke in Urdu, Urdu was considered the language of the West Pakistanis. Naturally this created a huge resentment among the Bengali students towards West Pakistan/Urdu.<br>
							There were two groups among the Pakistan Independence Movement activists [in the then East Pakistan]. One group was led by Nazimuddin and Nurul Amin, the other group was led by Suhrawardi and Abul Hashim. Nazimuddin’s group was supporting Urdu, so Suhrawardi’s group supported Bangla. We, followers of Shamsul Haq, were in this group.<br><br>
							Q: Can you say few words about Shamsul Haq?<br>
							GA: He was a very skilled qualified activist of the Pakistan Independence Movement. Later he was elected as the Muslim Secretary of the Awami League. He had significant contribution in the Language Movement.<br><br>
							Q: Who opposed Bangla being a state language? What mentality led them oppose this?<br>
							GA: There were different types of people within them. Some were blind followers of Quaide Azam Jinnah. They could not imagine differing with Quaide Azam in anything that he said. 
							The Ulama [religious scholars] of this country were pro Urdu. The reason may be that they were more familiar with Urdu than with Bangla. I remember an incident of Mawlana Deen Muhammad speaking at a Paltan rally. As he started his speech in Urdu, we students started shouting ‘Please speak in Bangla’. He responded saying, ‘You are not satisfied unless cinema films are in Urdu, but now you demand speech in Bangla’. We became silent after that. We did not have that many supporters, so he continued his speech in Urdu. <br>
							Nazimuddin’s followers were pro Urdu. Because they thought it was necessary for the integrity and unity of Pakistan to have only one state/official language, so they labeled the campaigners of the Language Movement as agents of Hindus and Communists.<br>
							Another group opposed the Language Movement- they wanted to establish a strong language [Urdu] for all Muslims in the Indian region to counter the influence of Hindi. <br><br>
							Q: What was the significance of the incident [general strike demanding Bangla as state language] on 11th March 1948? Did any public demonstration or strike take place for the Language Movement before then?<br>
							GA: I do not remember of any public demonstration or strike before 11th March. Before arrival of Quaide Azam Jinnah, there were campaigns for popularizing our demand as a mass public demand. 11th March deserves to be a historical day in this regard. It was mainly a student led demonstration in 1948. <br><br>
							Q: In what situation did the 7-points treaty between PM Nazimuddin and student leaders take place? Was it as a result of the 11th March strike?<br>
							GA: Nazimuddin signed the treaty with the student leaders in order to calm the situation. The main target was to calm the situation before the visit of Jinnah. The treaty was signed on 15th March. Yes, it was a result of 11th March. <br><br>
							Q: When did Quaide Azam visit Dhaka? Did anything unpleasant take place during his visit?<br>
							GA: He arrived in Dhaka on 19th March, 1948. He gave his speech at the Racecourse on 21st March. He gave his speech in English. I was seated in a corner at the backside of the stage. I was looking at Quaide Azam from behind. He was moving his arms and legs while giving the speech. I returned to my dormitory angry when he said that only Urdu will be the state language of Pakistan. I listened to the rest of his speech on a radio.<br>
							Nothing unpleasant took place except some ‘NO NO’ shouting in Curzon Hall. <br><br>
							Q: Did any heckling take place at the racecource? <br>
							GA: I did not witness anything like that. I could see only a part of the huge rally from my place. I did not see anything unpleasant happening. Not even when I was returning angry to my dormitory. No one spoke about anything unpleasant happening afterwards. <br><br>
							Q: Were you present during meetings between Quaide Azam and student representatives? Did anyone discuss the demand for the Language Movement during those meetings? <br>
							GA: Only Vice President and General Secretary of hall unions were present in those meetings. I was not present [as the GS of the central union]. Mr Toaha was the VP of our hall. We were members of the same group. <br><br>
							Q: Was Jinnah given any memorandum with demands for the Language?<br>
							GA: Yes, he was given a memorandum. I heard that, when he was told that there are examples of a country having more than one official language, he responded saying that he was aware of that. He became slightly irritated and said, ‘Now leave it to me’.<br><br>
							Q: Were you present at the convocation in Curzon hall?<br>
							GA: That was a special convocation. I was a Masters student at that time, so I was not present. Later, I heard about it from friends.<br><br>
							Q: You said that Mr Toaha was the VP of your hall. How was your relation with him?<br>
							GA: As I said earlier, we were members of the same group. We had a very cordial relationship. We used to walk together, eat together. Mr Toaha was a very good Quran reciter. He used to offer prayers. [Later in life Mr Toaha left religion.]<br><br>
							Q: When did PM Liakat Ali Khan visit Dhaka? Did he speak at any student rally in Dhaka?<br>
							GA: He visited Dhaka in 1948. I think it was during the winter. Yes, he gave a speech at a huge rally held in DU Gymnasium. The meeting was chaired by VC Sultan Uddin Ahmad.<br><br>
							Q: Was he presented with any memorandum on behalf of the students?<br>
							GA: Yes, he was given a memorandum on behalf of the students. As the then DACSU GS, I presented that memorandum. The demand for the language was at the end of the memorandum. Before that, we included some condemnation of regionalism and provincialism. As I remember, I repeated the paragraph regarding the language twice. There was huge applause after the first reading. As the applause stopped, I heard Mrs Rana Liakat saying to Mr Liakat, ‘Language bare may saf saf bata dena’ [say it very clearly about the language issue]. After hearing her whisper, I said to the audience, ‘Let me repeat this’, then I read the whole paragraph again. The audience again supported with huge applause. <br><br>
							Q: How is it you were given the responsibility to present this memorandum in that rally?<br>
							GA: For good reasons, student leaders from all 4 student hall unions agreed that the memorandum should be presented by someone from the DACSU. VP Mr Arbindu Gosh was a Hindu, so it was thought that the government would take it negatively if he presented it. So, as the GS of DACSU, I was given the responsibility.<br><br>
							Q: What did Liakat Ali Khan comment regarding the language issue?<br>
							GA: During his speech he made this comment, ‘if this is not provincialism, then what is provincialism?’ After hearing this we thought that he would say something very clear about the language issue, but he avoided it altogether.<br><br>
							Q: Who were the main initiators of the 11th March agitation/strike in 1948?<br>
							GA: It was a joint effort by the leaders of the hall unions and the Language Movement ExCo, They decided in agreement about the general strike and the public demonstration.<br><br>
							Q: What were the significant moments for the Language Movements after that?<br>
							GA: After 1948, the most significant moment was when Pakistani PM Khaza Nazimuddin declared in Paltan that only Urdu will be the official language. When he repeated what Quaide Azam said previously, the Language Movement turned into a public demand for the first time.<br><br>
							Q: When was the Dhaka University Language Committee established?<br>
							GA: I am not informed about this, I was a lecturer [in Rangpur] at that time.<br><br>
							Q: What was the role of the leftists in the Language Movement?<br>
							GA: As the leftists opposed the Pakistan Independence Movement, there were not many Muslims in leftist groups. The leftists did not have any visible activities. They became active after 1952. But even then they did not have any significant organization. Most of them used to work as part of the Awami Muslim League [father organization of the current Awami League]. So, there is no scope to view their role in the Language Movement in an isolated/special way.<br><br>
							Q: Did you have any contact or relation with Sheikh Mujib during your activist life at university?<br>
							GA: Sheikh Mujib was not a significant personality at that time. I first met him during the election campaign for JuktoFront in 1954. During the 1954 election campaign, Mr Suhrawardi [political mentor of Sheikh Mujib] went to speak at a camp of democratic activists in Rangpur. Sheikh Mujib was with him too. I was a lecturer at that time in Rangpur. Sheikh Mujib introduced me to Mr Suhrawardi saying, ‘This is the ex-GS of Dhaka University Central Students Union, DUCSU. He presented the memorandum with demand for the state language to PM Liakat Ali Khan in 1948’. Sheikh Mujib also mentioned about my then profession. <br><br>
							Q: Where were you in 1952? What was the situation of Language Movement at that place?<br>
							GA: I was at Rangpur Carmichael College. Some lecturers and students of that college were involved with the Language Movement. A few students and activists including myself and Mr Zamir Uddin were arrested at that time. <br><br>
							Q: Do you want to add anything more about the Language Movement?<br>
							GA: Even after Bangla was accepted as a state language of Pakistan, it was not possible to make it an official language of Pakistan. Now that Bangladesh is an independent country, we have the opportunity to establish Bangla as the official language of our country.<br>

                    	<h2>The Evidence warranting acquittal of PGA</h2>
                    	<p>1.	A total of 16 Prosecution Witnesses deposed in the case of Professor Ghulam Azam. Prosecution Witness No. 1 was Professor Muntasir Mamoon of the Department of History of the University of Dhaka. Admittedly he had no association with Professor Ghulam Azam before, during or after 1971, although he had been produced by the Prosecution to depose regarding the alleged commission of crimes against humanity by Professor Ghulam Azam. During cross examination on 1st July 2012, Professor Mamun admitted that he did not know Professor Ghulam Azam personally nor had he attended any of his meetings or assemblies. Furthermore, during cross examination on 4th July 2012, Professor Mamun admitted as not having any knowledge of atrocities committed in Dhanmondi during the time he was resident there in 1971. He also said that rarely used to leave his home. Professor Muntasir Mamun also completely failed to provide any information as to the leaders of the auxiliary forces of the Pakistan Army in the District of Chittagong where he was resident for several months in 1971. It is curious the Prosecution decided to produce Professor Mamun as the first Prosecution Witness, although admittedly he had no first hand information regarding the role of Professor Ghulam Azam in 1971. <br><br>

2.	The second Prosecution Witness was Mr. Mahbubuddin Ahmed Bir Bikrom. In his deposition, the Prosecution Witness did not make a single reference to any direct association with Professor Ghulam Azam in 1971, but said that he had heard that Professor Ghulam Azam, Khwaja Khaeruddin and Nurul Amin had met General Tikka Khan in the first week of April 1971. During the course of cross examination on 29th July 2012, the Prosecution Witness No. 2 admitted that he had contested the General Elections twice as a candidate of the Awami League, the present ruling party. He also admitted to not having made any allegation against Professor Ghulam Azam before the People’s Inquiry Commission, which was constituted in 1992. On 31st July 2012, the Prosecution Witness No. 2 admitted during cross examination that he did not know the members of the auxiliary forces in the District of Satkhira, where he had fought the war. As with the Prosecution Witness No. 1, the deposition of the Prosecution Witness No. 2 contains no direct evidence of commission of crimes against humanity by Professor Ghulam Azam. <br><br>

3.	The third Prosecution Witness was Advocate Sultana Kamal who stated in her deposition that she came to know about the activities of Professor Ghulam Azam in 1971 by reading newspapers. She also stated that in June 1971, she and her sister crossed the border to India. As such, it is clear that the Prosecution Witness was in Dhaka only for two months after the declaration of independence and that during this period she had no direct communication or association with Professor Ghulam Azam. Her knowledge of the activities of Professor Ghulam in 1971 was strictly limited to what she had heard and/or read in the newspapers. <br><br>

4.	Prosecution Witness Nos. 4-10 were all seizure list witnesses, who exhibited the documents and newspaper reports to be relied upon by the Prosecution. <br><br>

5.	Prosecution Witness No. 11 (Shafiuddin Ahmed), Prosecution Witness No. 12 (Sona Miah) and Prosecution Witness No. 13 (Anwara Begum) all deposed regarding the murder of SI Siru Miah and 38 others in Brahmanbaria by the Pakistan Army. Prosecution Witness No. 11 who was present with Siru Miah in Brahmanbaria in 1971 stated that he had heard from Siru Miah’s wife that she had procured a letter from Professor Ghulam Azam in an attempt to save her husband and son. He made no allegation implicating Professor Azam in the murder of Siru Miah. Prosecution Witness No. 12, Sona Miah made statements regarding the burial of freedom fighters by members of the auxiliary forces without making any reference to Professor Ghulam Azam. Prosecution Witness No. 13, Anwara Begum, wife of Siru Miah deposed that she had obtained a letter from Professor Ghulam Azam through his brother-in-law, Mohsin Ali Khan in an attempt to save her husband and son. She also stated that the Brahmanbaria Peace Committee President, Piyara Miah had informed her brother, Fazlur Rahman of an earlier letter sent by Professor Ghulam Azam directing the killing of Siru Miah and his companions. Incidentally, Mohsin Ali Khan is currently in the United States with his daughter. His statement to the Investigating Officer was received in evidence under section 19(2) of the Act on the prayer of the Prosecution, although no evidence has been brought before the Tribunal in the form of travel documents/boarding pass etc. to establish that he had left Bangladesh for the United States. <br><br>

6.	It is undisputed that both Piyara Miah and Fazlur Rahman had died long ago and that the letters allegedly sent by Professor Ghulam Azam directing the killing of Siru Miah and/or to save them are not available. During the course of cross examination on 1st October 2012, Anwara Begum admitted that she had not seen the contents of the letter handed over to Fazlur Rahman by Mohsin Ali Khan because it was in a sealed envelope and that neither she nor Fazlur Rahman were familiar with the handwriting or signature of Professor Ghulam Azam. Thus, not only do the letters allegedly issued by Professor Ghulam Azam not exist, but also those who had seen the letter (i.e., Piyara Miah) or heard its contents (i.e., Fazlur Rahman) are no longer alive. <br><br>

7.	That Prosecution Witness No. 14 was Ahmed Imitiaz Bulbul, a reputed musician. He was Siru Miah’s companion in Brahmanbaria Central Jail in 1971. During his deposition he made no reference whatsoever to Professor Ghulam Azam. Prosecution Witness No. 15 (Sheikh Farid Alam) deposed regarding the location of the office of Jamaat-e-Islami. Prosecution Witness No. 16 was the Investigating Officer in the case of Professor Ghulam Azam. <br><br>

<h2>Defence Witness.</h2>
Defence examined only one witness, Abdullahil Amaan Azmi, the son of Professor Ghulam Azam <br><br>
<h2>Major irregularities in the trial</h2>
i.	On 10th April 1992, at a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Lawyers Co-ordination Council (Ainjibin Shomonnoy Parishad), a resolution was adopted by the members, including the Chairman of the Hon’ble Tribunal-1 demanding that the Government should take legal measures for implementation of the verdict of death penalty of the so-called People’s Court against Professor Ghulam Azam. The news of the meeting which was attended by the Chairman of the Hon’ble Tribunal -1 was reported on 11th April 1992 in the Daily Sangbad. In the background of the news coming to the knowledge of the defence, an application was filed for transferring PGA’s case from ICT-1 to ICT-2, in the alternative for the recusal of the Chairman Md. Nizamul Huq Nasim, which was rejected on 18 June 2012 by Order No. 33.<br><br>
ii.	Applications for bail were filed on four occasions but every time it was rejected, although the Tribunal failed to arrive at any finding that there was a likelihood that PGA would flee from the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. <br><br>
iii.	Application for providing Division-1 status to PGA was filed but the application was disposed of by Order No. 99 issuing merely a direction upon the relevant authorities to consider the Applicant’s application on merit.<br><br>
iv.	Conditional order on the application for supplying home cooked food to PGA: Although, there is a specific provision in the Prisons Act and the Jail Code to allow home cooked food to be supplied to prisoners, the Tribunal unlawfully attached a condition to the order, holding that PGA’s family members will be permitted to supply home cooked food to him only if they sign an undertaking that the jail authorities will not be responsible for the medical/health condition of the Accused after taking home cooked food. PGA’s son was willing to issue the undertaking but only if a representative of the family was allowed to be present at the time of PGA taking the food (so as to ensure that the home-cooked food has not been tampered with after being supplied by the family). The Tribunal was not inclined to accept this condition and therefore the order never became effective.<br><br>
v.	ICT-1 rejected the Defence application for issuing summons upon two foreign witnesses by Order No. 80 dated 18 October 2012.
vi.	Application for discharge/App for review of Charge Framing Order (CFO): The lack of specificity of the CFO is a major problem that the Defence had to face. The CFO merely sets out the statements/press releases/press briefings of PGA and then leaps to the conclusion that as a result 3 million died and 200,000 were raped, for which PGA is responsible. The charges against PGA were vague thus making it impossible for the Defence to effectively respond to them. In fact, PGA was being prosecuted for supporting the cause of united Pakistan – which is not a Crime Against Humanity or a war crime. <br><br>
vii.	Upon publication of the controversial skype conversations and email communications of former chairman of ICT-1, Mr. Justice Nizamul Huq Nasim with Dr. Zia Uddin an application for retrial of PGA's case was filed which was rejected on 3 January 2013 by Order No. 123.<br><br>
viii.	Time limits on cross examination of Investigating Officer: The entire case against PGA is predicated on news reports containing his statements and press releases in 1971. These reports were exhibited by the librarian of Bangla Academy. But the Defence was not allowed to cross-examine the librarian of Bangla Academy regarding the contents of the news reports by the Tribunal. However, time limits were arbitrarily placed on the cross examination of the IO. Accordingly, the Defence was deprived of a sufficient opportunity to cross examine the Investigating Officer on the veracity of the contents of the each of the exhibited news reports (on the basis of which PGA is being tried). Although subsequently application were filed to allow the Defence to put certain important questions to the Investigating Officer – all such applications were rejected. <br><br>

<h2>Summary of Defence Case</h2>
A.	CONSPIRACY<br><br>

1.	There are 6 counts of conspiracy against the Accused. Conspiracy to commit crimes under section 3(2) of the 1973 Act is punishable under section 3(2)(g) of the said Act. <br>

2.	In order to prove the offence of conspiracy to commit genocide, the Prosecution is required to establish the following beyond reasonable doubt: <br><br>
ACTUS REUS:<br>
(i)	Existence of an agreement between the Accused and one or more persons to commit the crime of genocide (Actus Reus) (Para 894, Nahimana (Appeals Chamber)).<br>
(ii)	Agreement may be proved by direct evidence. Agreement may also be inferred from circumstantial evidence. Concerted or coordinated action on the part of the conspirators can constitute evidence of an agreement. However, where existence of an agreement is to be proved from circumstantial evidence, the existence of a conspiracy to commit genocide must be the only reasonable inference based on the totality of the evidence (Paras 896, 897, Nahimana (Appeals Chamber)). <br>
(iii)	Since conspiracy to commit genocide is an inchoate offence, it is not necessary to prove that genocide occurred pursuant to the conspiracy. <br><br>

MENS REA:<br>
(iv)	The Accused had the intent to destroy in whole or in part a national, ethnical, racial, religious or political group, which is also known as the genocidal intent (Mens Rea) (Para 894, Nahimana (Appeals Chamber)). <br>
(v)	It is difficult to find explicit manifestations of genocidal intent. In most cases, genocidal intent will be proved by circumstantial evidence (Para 93, Kayishema (Trial Chamber). In such cases, it is necessary that the finding that the accused had the genocidal intent be the only reasonable inference from the totality of the evidence (Para 524, Nahimana (Appeals Chamber))<br>
(vi)	Genocidal intent presupposes that victims are chosen by reason of the membership in the group whose destruction in sought (Para 561, Radislav Krstic (Trial Chamber)). <br>

3.	It is the Defence case that the Prosecution has failed to produce any evidence on record to establish that any agreement was reached between the Accused and any other person to commit any crimes under section 3(2) of the Act. As such, the Actus Reus of the offence of conspiracy has not been established beyond reasonable doubt. <br>

4.	Furthermore, no evidence has been brought on record by the Prosecution to show that the Accused had the intent to destroy in whole or in part a national, ethnic, racial, religious or political group. There is no evidence on record on the basis of which such genocidal intent may be inferred. Also, the Prosecution has not even attempted to establish that the alleged targets of the conspiracy were chosen by reason of the membership in the group whose destruction was sought. <br><br>

B.	PLANNING<br>

1.	There are 3 counts of Planning against the Accused. <br>

2.	Planning is not an offence under section 3(2) of the Act. However, under section 4(2), a ‘superior officer’ or ‘commander’ who is connected with any plans and activities involving the commission of crimes under section 3(2) of the Act is guilty of such crimes.  <br>

3.	There is no allegation in the Formal Charge or the Charge Framing Order that the Accused was a ‘superior officer’ or ‘commander’ in 1971. Further, no Prosecution Witness has made any statement identifying the Accused as a ‘superior officer’ or ‘commander’. As such, no question arises of attracting liability under section 4(2) of the Act. <br>

4.	The Prosecution has alleged that Planning is a crime under international law and as such punishable under section 3(2)(f) of the 1973 Act. However, there is no evidence to show that Planning commission of Genocide is a crime under international law. The Genocide Convention makes no reference to the offence of planning commission of genocide. It is pointed out however that Planning the commission of Crimes against Humanity was punishable under the Nuremberg Charter. <br>

5.	Under the ICTY and ICTR Statutes, Planning the commission of genocide or Crimes Against Humanity is an offence. <br>

6.	Under the ICTY and ICTR Statutes, in order to prove the offence of Planning, the Prosecution has to establish the following beyond reasonable doubt:<br><br>

ACTUS REUS:<br>
(i)	That one or more persons designed the criminal conduct constituting one or more statutory crimes that are later perpetrated. It is sufficient to demonstrate that the planning was a factor substantially contributing to such criminal conduct (Para 479, Nahimana (Appeals Chamber). <br>
(ii)	Planning presupposes that one or more persons contemplate the commission of a crime at both its preparatory and execution phases (Para 271, Gacumbitsi (Trial Chamber). The level of participation in planning must be substantial, such as actually formulating a plan or endorsing a plan proposed by another person (Para 761, Kajelijeli (Trial Chamber). <br><br>

MENS REA:<br>
(iii)	The mens rea for this mode of responsibility entails the intent to plan the commission of a crime, or at a minimum, the awareness of substantial likelihood (Para 479, Nahimana (Appeals Chamber).<br> 

7.	Planning is not an inchoate offence. <br>

8.	It is the Defence case that no evidence has been brought on record by the Prosecution to establish that the Accused designed the criminal conduct constituting a crime under section 3(2) of the Act that was later perpetrated. There is no evidence show that the Accused contemplated the commission of a specific crime at both its preparatory and execution phases and that the level of his participation was substantial. Further, the Prosecution has failed to identify a specific offence or incident of atrocities which was perpetrated pursuant to any plans of the Accused. No evidence has been brought on record to show that the Accused’s conduct substantially contributed to the commission of a specific offence punishable under section 3(2) of the Act. As such, the Prosecution has failed to prove the Actus Reus of the offence of Planning. <br>

9.	The Prosecution has also not proved that the Accused had the intent to plan the commission of a specific crime. <br><br>

C.	INCITEMENT<br>

1.	There are 28 counts of Incitement against the Accused. <br>

2.	Incitement is not an offence which has been specifically mentioned in section 3(2) of the 1973 Act. However, ‘Direct and Public Incitement to commit genocide’ is punishable under Article 3(c) of the Genocide Convention (which is reflective of customary international law) and as such, the same is a crime under international law punishable under section 3(2)(f) of the Act. Therefore in order to determine the elements of crime of ‘Direct and Public Incitement to commit Genocide’, it is necessary to refer to Article 2 of the Genocide Convention. <br>

3.	According to Article 2 of the Genocide Convention, genocide may be committed of 4 groups – (i) national group, (ii) ethnical group, (iii) racial group and (iv) religious group. <br>

4.	Incitement to commit Genocide is an inchoate offence. Therefore it is not necessary to prove that genocide has occurred in order to prove the offence of incitement to commit genocide (Para 678, Nahimana (Appeals Chamber)).<br>

5.	There is no evidence to show that ‘Incitement to commit Crimes Against Humanity’ is a crime under international law punishable under section 3(2)(f) of the Act. <br>

6.	In order to prove the offence of ‘Direct and Public Incitement to commit Genocide’, the Prosecutor has to establish the following beyond reasonable doubt:<br><br>

ACTUS REUS: <br>
(i)	The ‘public’ element of the offence requires there to be a call for criminal action to a number of individuals in a public place or members of the general public against members of any of the 4 protected groups under the Genocide Convention (Para 851, Kajelijeli (Trial Chamber)).<br>
(ii)	The ‘direct’ element of the offence requires specifically urging another individual to take immediate criminal action (Para 852, Kajelijeli (Trial Chamber). The direct element requires one to specifically provoke another to engage in a criminal act. More than mere vague or indirect suggestion is required (Para 557, Akayesu (Trial Chamber)).<br> 
(iii)	Implicit language may however be direct. Therefore, the Court has to consider the cultural and linguistic content of the speech (Para 557, Akayesu (Trial Chamber). The Court has to consider the whether in light of the culture of the country and the specific circumstances of the case, the persons for whom the message was intended immediately grasped the implication thereof (Para 558, Akayesu (Trial Chamber)). <br><br>

MENS REA: <br>
(iv)	The mens rea required for the crime of direct and public incitement to commit genocide is the intent to directly prompt or provoke another to commit genocide (Para 560, Akayesu (Trial Chamber)). <br>
(v)	The person who is inciting to commit genocide must have himself the genocidal intent, i.e., the specific intent to destroy in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group (Para 560, Akayesu (Trial Chamber)). <br>
(iv)	It is difficult to find explicit manifestations of genocidal intent. In most cases, genocidal intent will be proved by circumstantial evidence (Para 93, Kayishema (Trial Chamber). In such cases, it is necessary that the finding that the accused had the genocidal intent be the only reasonable inference from the totality of the evidence (Para 524, Nahimana (Appeals Chamber))<br>
(vi)	Genocidal intent presupposes that victims are chosen by reason of the membership in the group whose destruction in sought (Para 561, Radislav Krstic (Trial Chamber)).<br>

7.	It is the Defence case that the Prosecution has failed to produce any evidence to show that the statements and speeches of the Accused were targeted against members of any ‘national’, ‘ethnic’, ‘racial’ or ‘religious’ group. The Defence relies on paragraphs 512-516 of the Akayesu trial judgment for definitions of what constitutes a ‘national’, ‘ethnic’, ‘racial’ or ‘religious’ group. The Defence has referred to Prosecution Exhibits, including Fortnightly Reports, to show that the terms ‘miscreants’, ‘rebels’, ‘separatists’, ‘enemies’, ‘anti-state elements’ and ‘infiltrators/intruders’ were used in 1971 to refer to armed Freedom fighters engaged in liberation struggle/armed insurgents who had crossed the border to assist in the armed struggle for liberation. The Defence has argued that there is no scope for armed freedom fighters or armed insurgents to fall into one of the 4 protected groups under the Genocide Convention. As such, the Accused’s statements/speeches targeting ‘miscreants’, ‘rebels’, ‘separatists’, ‘enemies’, ‘anti-state elements’ and ‘infiltrators/intruders’ does not amount to incitement to commit genocide of any of the protected groups under the Genocide the Convention. Therefore the Prosecution has failed to prove the Actus Reus of the offence of incitement to commit genocide. <br>

8.	Furthermore, no evidence has been brought on record by the Prosecution to show that the Accused had the intent to destroy in whole or in part a national, ethnic, racial or religious. There is no evidence on record on the basis of which such genocidal intent may be inferred. The Prosecution has failed to show that the Accused in his statements/speeches targeted members of an ethnic group on account of their ethnicity or members of a religious group on account of their religious beliefs. <br><br>

D.	COMPLICITY<br>

1.	There are 23 counts of complicity against the Accused Petitioner. <br>

2.	Complicity in the commission of Genocide/Crimes Against Humanity is an offence under section 3(2)(h) of the 1973 Act. <br>

3.	In order to prove the offence of Complicity in the commission of crimes under section 3(2) of the Act, the Prosecution is required to establish the following beyond reasonable doubt:<br><br>

ACTUS REUS:<br>
(i)	That the Accused provided assistance or encouragement that substantially contributed to or have had a substantial effect on the completion of the crime (Para 395, Semanza (Trial Chamber)).<br><br>
MENS REA:<br>
(ii)	That the Accused must have acted intentionally with the awareness that he was contributing to the crime of genocide, including all its material elements (Para 395, Semanza (Trial Chamber)). <br>

4.	Complicity is not an inchoate offence. <br>

5.	It is the Defence case that no evidence has been brought on record by the Prosecution to establish that the Accused provided assistance or encouragement to the perpetrators of a specific offence that substantially contributed to or had a substantial impact on the commission of an offence punishable under section 3(2) of the Act. The Prosecution has failed to identify a specific offence or incident of atrocities which was perpetrated pursuant to any actions of the Accused. No evidence has been brought on record to show that the Accused’s conduct/action substantially contributed to the commission of a specific offence punishable under section 3(2) of the Act. As such, the Prosecution has failed to prove the Actus Reus of the offence of Complicity. <br>

6.	The Prosecution has also not proved that the Accused acted intentionally with the awareness that he was contributing to the crime of genocide, including all its material elements. <br>
